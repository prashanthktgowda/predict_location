Overview
The project uses a linear regression model to predict geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) from an address input. Using deep learning techniques, the model can generalize well on unseen data, offering reliable predictions even with minimal inputs.

Key Features:
Predicts latitude and longitude based on address data
Utilizes a linear regression model for accurate predictions
Built with scalability in mind for integrating additional geolocation data
Project Structure
data/: Contains raw datasets for model training and validation.
model/: Stores the trained model file (model.pkl).
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks with exploratory data analysis and model-building steps.
src/: Includes Python scripts for data processing, training, and prediction.

Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/deep-learning-geolocation.git
cd deep-learning-geolocation
Install Dependencies: Install required packages using requirements.txt:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Prepare the Data:

Ensure your data file is formatted with columns Address, City, State, and Pincode (additional columns like Latitude and Longitude for supervised training).
Load and preprocess data using data_preprocess.py script.
Train the Model:

Run the train_model.py file to train the linear regression model on the dataset.
bash
Copy code
python src/train_model.py
Make Predictions:

Use predict.py to predict latitude and longitude for a given address.
bash
Copy code
python src/predict.py --address "123 Example St, CityName, State"
Dataset
For this project, a dataset containing addresses and their associated latitude and longitude values is used to train and validate the model. Make sure the dataset is stored in the data/ directory.

Model Training
The model is a linear regression model trained on address-based data points. The target output is the latitude and longitude, which are predicted from the address data features.

Training Configuration
Model: Linear Regression
Optimizer: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
Loss Function: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Results
The model achieves high accuracy in predicting latitude and longitude within a reasonable margin of error. Performance metrics and further results can be found in the results/ directory.

Future Improvements
Potential improvements include:

Implementing additional deep learning models to enhance accuracy.
Adding support for different geolocation data sources.
Expanding the address parsing capabilities.
